# Finstack Quant UI contracts

PR-001 of the component registry: offline JSON Schema bundles, generated wire
interfaces, field metadata, fixture discovery and a lazy instrument catalogue.
This is a standalone Node 24 package. No registry components ship in this slice.

```sh
mise run wasm-pkg
mise run ui-sync
mise run ui-gen
mise run ui-check
```

`ui-sync` installs the lockfile with lifecycle scripts disabled. The linked WASM
package is built explicitly by `wasm-pkg`; dependency installation does not launch
Rust or Python builds. `ui-check` checks generated drift, handwritten formatting,
TypeScript and the package's Vitest tests. It does not run the library suites.

```ts
import { instruments } from "finstack-quant-ui/instruments";

const bond = instruments.find((entry) => entry.type === "bond")!;
const { validator, example, schema, metadata } = await bond.loader();
const result = validator.safeParse(example);
```

Each loader imports its schema, metadata and example only when selected. ESM
caches the module and its validator. The catalogue has no static imports of Zod,
schemas, metadata or examples. Individual wire types are exported by the loaded
module, and live under `src/generated/types/` for type-only imports.

## Ownership and generation

`scripts/gen.mjs` reads the canonical crate schema indexes by URI. Ref Parser
resolves offline with both network and filesystem fallback disabled. Only
reachable definitions enter each bundle; stable URI-derived keys distinguish
same-named definitions, retain recursive references and preserve reference
annotations. Metadata uses JSON Schema pointers plus original canonical source
pointers and refs, including non-`type` discriminator constants. Defaults,
descriptions and supplied `x-` annotations remain in the committed bundles.
Numeric type or a decimal reference never assigns a financial unit.

The fixture manifest is rediscovered from the instrument example directory and
calibration bootstrap directory. Every instrument root requires one example.
Calibration envelopes validate as inputs; an optional returned `final_market`
is recorded separately against the market-state schema. Fixture filenames and
counts are not hard-coded. All generated files are committed; `--check` compares
contents and detects missing and stale files without writing them.

The [Zod converter](https://zod.dev/json-schema) is experimental, so its exact
version is pinned. The small converter projection removes validation-time
default insertion, preserves `$ref` sibling assertions, and lowers the canonical
closed object union only when required, distinct string discriminators prove
branches disjoint. Other `unevaluatedProperties` shapes fail generation. Tuple
schemas are projected to the TypeScript generator's supported tuple syntax.
Original bundles remain unchanged by these projections. Ajv 2020-12 is a
test-only oracle for the supported construct and boundary corpus.

## Validation boundary

These validators establish JSON structure, not financial validity. Rust/WASM
still owns schedules, market lookups, cross-field rules, pricing and calibration.
No financial rules, unit tables or arithmetic are implemented here.

Generated interfaces describe wire shapes and cannot express every runtime
constraint (bounds, patterns or exclusive unions). They are not WASM host types.
PR-002 owns lossless wide-integer transport, actual facade-shape checks, contract
provenance and integration with the repository generation digest. Until then,
ordinary JSON-number parsing is not a canonical import/export path for integers
above JavaScript's safe range, and generated validators must not be used on
structured WASM results containing `bigint` or typed arrays. Later phase gates
own browser footprint, static worker feasibility and component installation.
