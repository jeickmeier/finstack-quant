//! Request-scoped portfolio evaluation planning and execution.
//!
//! This module is the single production path for portfolio position pricing,
//! state-local pricing-option ownership, Rayon scheduling, and deterministic
//! valuation assembly. Public workflow functions remain in their existing
//! modules and compile their work into this internal executor.
