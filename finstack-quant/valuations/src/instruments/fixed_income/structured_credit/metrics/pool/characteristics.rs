/// Calculates WAM (Weighted Average Maturity) for the underlying pool.
///
/// WAM measures the weighted average time until assets in the pool mature,
/// based on the original legal maturities (not expected prepayment life like WAL).
///
/// # Formula
///
/// WAM = Σ(Balance_i × Years_to_Maturity_i) / Σ(Balance_i)
///
/// # Typical Values
///
/// - **CLO**: 5-7 years
/// - **ABS**: 3-5 years
/// - **RMBS**: 25-30 years (legal maturity, much longer than WAL)
/// - **CMBS**: 7-10 years

/// Calculates CPR (Constant Prepayment Rate) assumption.
///
/// CPR is the annualized rate at which the pool is assumed to prepay.

/// # Formula
///
/// CPR = annualized prepayment rate (e.g., 0.15 = 15% CPR)
///
/// # Sources
///
/// - **RMBS**: Derived from PSA speed
/// - **ABS**: From ABS speed assumption
/// - **CMBS**: From open period CPR
/// - **CLO**: Default prepayment assumption

/// # Typical Values
///
/// - **CLO**: 2-3% base case, 5-10% stress
/// - **ABS (auto)**: 1-2% base case
/// - **RMBS**: 0.5-1% base case (agency)
